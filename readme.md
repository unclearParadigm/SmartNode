# SmartNode

is a JSON-based RESTful API providing easy-access to GPIOs of various Singleboard Computers and Developer-Boards (such as Arduino, RasperryPi, Odroid and much more)
via HTTP. This WebApi is meant to remotely control whatever is connected to the GPIOs of the board, therefore it
is ideally for low-budget SmartHome applications.
